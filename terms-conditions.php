        <br>
        <h5 class="sub-heading">REFUND POLICY</h5>
        <br>
        <p>It is important that you read and fully understand the refund policy in order to have full knowledge of the privileges and limitations governed by the My Books Writer Policy.</p>
        <p>We offer refunds only in special cases and specified conditions, detailed as under:</p>
        <h6 class="page-title">Change of Mind</h6>
        <p>The customer is entitled to 100% refund before our writers/editors start working on the project.</p>
        <p>If (for any reason) you change your mind and decide against continuing your project with us after placing your order, you can ask for a refund within the first hour of placing your order. A 15% processing fee will be charged in other cases.</p>
        <br>
        <h6 class="page-title">Incompetent Delivery</h6>
        <p>Once the work is delivered, customers are only entitled to claim a refund once they have exhausted all the options detailed as under;</p>
        <p>If it does not comply with project requirements (as requested/documented by the customer). We are committed to providing our customers with 100% satisfaction and offer unlimited revisions to ensure that the delivery is up to the mark. We first assign, re-assign and re-write your work to ensure complete satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Reserve FREE Pages for future, but of same value and you can avail them at any time.</p>
        <p>If we’re still not able to deliver what you asked for, the refund will be processed with a mutual agreement on a set percentage (but only in the cases where the delivery is completely off the mark).</p>
        <br>
        <h6 class="page-title">Late Delivery</h6>
        <p>We believe in “On-time Delivery” but if, for any reason we fail to deliver the requested services on time, after at least three (03) attempts to contact us, your refund will be processed once it is established through documentary evidence that the late delivery was the company’s fault.</p>
        <br>
        <h6 class="page-title">Refund Time Frame</h6>
        <p>Refunds must be claimed within 120 days of delivery. Refunds claimed after the set time frame will not be entertained.</p>
        <p>All the customers must note the deadline for claiming refund at the time of placing order.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>Cases where Refund will not be Issued</h6>
        <p>In case of late delivery due to some minor technical errors, such as grammatical, typing, word count, missing references etc., refunds will be processed with mutual agreement and the company will only settle with partial refund or discounts reserved for future purchases.</p>
        <p>The company will not be responsible for any delay from the client’s end.</p>
        <p>No refund will be issued on the basis of low-yield writing.</p>
